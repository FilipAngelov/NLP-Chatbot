# Brainster Chatbot - Rubik

## Description
Brainster chatbot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in Python and its libraris which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of known conversations. Main purpose for Brainster chatbot is asnwering questions to all visitors of the website and facebook business page. Questions are connected with all academies, courses and bootcapms organized by Brainster. Moreover you can get more familier withh all departments that one day you will be part of it.

# How it works
An untrained instance of Chatbot starts to communicate. Each time a user enters a question, the algoritham saves the text that they entered and classify the question in which sections belong. After that the program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known question that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that question based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.
