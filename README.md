# How it works
An untrained instance of Chatbot starts to communicate. Each time a user enters a question, the algoritham saves the text that they entered and classify the question in which sections belong. After that the program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known question that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that question based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.
